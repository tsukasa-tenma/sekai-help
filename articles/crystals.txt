New players can get a lot of crystals at first by reading area conversations and raising Character Ranks to 5. After that, crystal income slows down considerably, but there are a number of ways to obtain them.

# F2P Crystal Sources

## New Player Specific
- Intro missions: 3000(?)
- Welcome virtual lives: 300 each.
- Normal missions (second tab below the monthly missions): 50 each

## Permanent (can be gotten once and doesn't expire)
- Songs: 300 per song (110 for S score rank, 50 for Hard FC, 70 for Expert FC, 70 for Master FC)
- Player Level: 50 per level up, also 500 every 10th level (up to 300, after that every 10th level gives 5 big cans)
- Character Rank: 500-600 (2-3 100s and one 300) every 5 ranks per character. Rank 5 for all characters can be achieved day 1, rank 10 can be done fairly easily with enough kakera, rank 15+ takes a while.
- Challenge Live: 3400 per character for score rewards (1 million pts, though this takes a lot of time and gacha to achieve). Also, 50 per challenge stage completed. (Note: A 1 million pt run on a new character clears 3 stages without colorful pass and 4 stages with it.)
